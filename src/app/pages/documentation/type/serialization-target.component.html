<h2>Serialization target</h2>

<p>
    A serialization target is a serializer for a specific target. For example a target could be JSON.
    Deepkit Type comes with a JSON serialization target out of the box that allows you to convert JavaScript
    types to JSON types. Note that the serialization process only creates an object with the new property types
    that are necessary for the actual encoding. It does not produce for example a JSON string, but a JSON object.
</p>

<p>
    In order to produce a JSON string, you have to call the JSON serializer, and then on the result JSON.stringify().
</p>

<h3>Create a new serialization target</h3>

<p>
    In order to create a serialization target you have to create a new Serializer object, give it a name, and register
    compiler templates. Compiler templates are little functions that create JavaScript code for the JIT serializer
    process.
    Each type (string, number, etc) has its own compiler template that is responsible to return code that does the data
    conversion.
    That code has to be compatible to the JavaScript engine a user is using. That code also has limited access to
    the class schema being used. Only during the execution of the compiler template function do you have full access to
    the
    class/property schema. The idea is that you should embed all information necessary to convert a type in the code
    directly, leading
    to code that is highly optimized (aka JIT optimized code).
</p>


<p>
    The following example creates an empty serializer.
</p>

<textarea codeHighlight title="app.ts">
    import 'reflect-metadata';
    import { t, Serializer } from '@deepkit/type';

    class User {
        @t name: string = '';
        @t created: Date = new Date;
    }

    const mySerializer = new Serializer('mySerializer');

    const user = mySerializer.for(User).deserialize({ name: 'Peter', created: 0 });
    console.log('empty serializer', user);
</textarea>

<textarea codeHighlight>
    $ ts-node app.ts
    empty serializer User { name: 'Peter', created: 0 }
</textarea>

As you can see nothing has been converted (<code>created</code> is still a number, but we defined it as
<code>Date</code>).
To change that we add a compiler template for the deserialization of type <code>date</code>.

<textarea codeHighlight>
    //from class to target means deserialization.
    mySerializer.toClass.register('date', (property, compiler) => {
        compiler.addSetter(`new Date(${compiler.accessor})`);
    });

    //we need to reset the JIT cache, since we changed the serializer
    //only needed in our example here if you used the serializer before using the register() method
    getClassSchema(User).resetCache();

    console.log(mySerializer.for(User).deserialize({ name: 'Peter', created: 0 }));
</textarea>

<textarea codeHighlight>
$ ts-node app.ts
User { name: 'Peter', created: 2021-06-10T19:34:27.301Z }
</textarea>

<p>
    Now our serializer converts the value to a Date object.
</p>


<p>
    In order to to the same for serialization, we register a compiler template for serialization (fromClass).
</p>


<textarea codeHighlight>
//from class to target means serialization.
mySerializer.fromClass.register('date', (property, state) => {
    state.addSetter(`${state.accessor}.toJSON();`);
});

//we need to reset the JIT cache, since we changed the serializer
//only needed in our example here if you used the serializer before using the register() method
getClassSchema(User).resetCache();

const user1 = new User();
user1.name = 'Peter';
user1.created = new Date('2021-06-10T19:34:27.301Z');
console.log(mySerializer.for(User).serialize(user1));
</textarea>

<textarea codeHighlight>
{ name: 'Peter', created: '2021-06-10T19:34:27.301Z' }
</textarea>

<p>
    Our new serializer now correctly converts the date from Date object to a string in the serialization process.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

To see many more examples, you can take a look into the code of the
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/deepkit/deepkit-framework/blob/master/packages/type/src/json-serializer.ts">JSON
    serializer</a>
included in Deepkit Type.

<p>There you'll find many examples of making compile time data available during the actual serialization (the generated
    JIT function).</p>

<h3>Extend a serializer</h3>

<p>
    When you want to extend an already existing serializer you can do so using the <code>fork</code> method.
</p>

<textarea codeHighlight>
const mySerializer = jsonSerializer.fork('mySerializer');

//We overwrite how the JsonSerializer handles dates during deserialization.
mySerializer.toClass.register('date', (property, state) => {
     state.addSetter(`${state.accessor} === 0 ? undefined : new Date(${state.accessor})`);
 });
</textarea>
